# burger
Burger is an application that takes users input to make a list of burgers they'd like to eat. Once submitted the burger name, will appear on the left hand side of the screen in a list. Each burger will also have a "Devour" button that will send that particular burger to the other side of the screen.

## About the Project
Burger is a hosted project that allows the user to add any type of burger they can imagine to a list, along with a button labled "devour". Once the button is pressed, the burger is defined as being devoured and is moved to another location on the HTML page. This page demonstrates the practice of manipulating the HTML page by using express-handlebars and a database to turn an otherwise static HTML page into a basic, yet dynamic HTML experience.

## Getting Started
This project is hosted by heroku, simply navigate to the URL in your favoirte browser and add some burgers to your list.

## Usage
On the landing page you will be presented with an input box. Type the name of a burger in the box and submit your input.

Once you have submitted the buger, it will be added to a list on the left hand side of the screen, along with a button.

Click the "devour" button to re-define that particular buger as "devoured" and it will then be sent to the right side of the screen.

Repeat until you pass out or being experiencing "the burger sweats"
